===========

This is a personal project, just for fun. 

I'm using this project as a way to test som Octet Framework capacities. 
It's supposed to be a non-stop running game. I want to add some "physics" with the Bullet library.
It's being programed in C++.

It's just a personal project, as an entertainment, that will let me get ready for this September 2014,
  when I will start the MSc CG&E at Goldsmiths, University of London.
  
Wish me luck!
